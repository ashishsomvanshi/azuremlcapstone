*NOTE:* This file is a template that you can use to create the README for your project. The *TODO* comments below will highlight the information you should be sure to include.
## Note :
     The Deletion Section Shows an Error simply because the deployed Endpoint Service was deleted priror to deletion of compute target. Also the Notebooks are direct download of the code on Azure ML Studio. The same can be observed in the Full Video Recording Provided in the Screencast Section. 

## ML Task to determine death event baaed on various risk factors from different body parameters
*TODO:* Write a short introduction to your project.
    The Experiment is to predict the death event baaed on various risk factors from diffrent body parameters from the chossen datset using Azure Machine Learning Studio and select the models generated via Hyperdive Confugration and via Azure AutoML.
## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.
    The requireed azure ml workspace and experiment was created and azure ml studio was used to run Azure ML Notebooks which inturn ran on coumte vms and calulations were done via the jupyter notebook on a 4 node cluster of cloud based VMs of size STANDARD_D2_V2. To avoid duplication same compute resourses and datset created were used for both hyperdrive method and automl method.

## Improving Results
    In future we can improve the best model by choosing different primary metrics and different classification methods and calculating and comparing the values of mean_squared_error, to study how our predictions have deviated from actual values and, we study mean absolute percent error (MAPE) in detail. We can also study the impact of increasing number of clusters used to study to get faster results. All these could help us in reducing error in our model and help us to study the model much faster. We can also add more data to the model, or we can add more columns. Also, we can make new columns with existing ones with feature engineering and by applying our domain knowledge and obtain better results. Also, we can provide a more user-friendly user interface wile consuming the apiâ€™s and the swager documentation. Lot of steps run on command-line can be ran directly from Jyupiter notebook or could be automated in a single script. We do have room to select more hyperparameters to tune in addtion to the two selected and tuned.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search
    First the data was loaded into dataset and proper compute infra was created to run with suitable hyperdrive configuration. Random Sampling was choosen as it supports early termination of low-performance runs. In random sampling, hyperparameter values are randomly selected from the defined search space.
    
    Random Sampling was choosen as it supports early termination of low-performance runs. In random sampling, hyperparameter values are randomly selected from the defined search space with two hyperparameters '--C' (Reqularization Strength) and '--max_iter' (Maximum iterations to converge).
    
    enable_early_stopping = true, enables early termination if the score is not improving in the short term. BanditPolicy is an "aggressive" early stopping policy with the meaning that cuts more runs.

## Classification technique used: 
    Logistic Regression (Collumn to be classifed : DEATH_EVENT)

## Best Run Selection: 
    Selected out of multiple runs with same algorititm with diffrent hyperparameters.

## Confrugration Selected:
    Primary_metric= 'Accuracy'

## Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?
*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.
    With the above selected confugration the Hyperdrive Pipeline shows best results with --c = 500 and --max_iter = 50 giving accuracy of  0.8133333333333334(approximate).

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.
    The best performing model was a model with acuuracy of aproximately .0.8926726726726727 with AUC_weight =  0.9208363636363636 using VotingEnsemble algoritim obtained via AutoML Method. The respective model was registered and deployed as rest endpoint via a scoring uri and the deployment was verified by sending two sets of data picked from the original dataset and sent as JSON data to the service and the service predicted the output correctly.
