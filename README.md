## ML Task to determine death event baaed on various risk factors from different body parameters
    The Experiment is to predict the death event baaed on various risk factors from diffrent body parameters from the chossen datset using Azure Machine Learning Studio and select the models generated via Hyperdive Confugration and via Azure AutoML.
## Project Set Up and Installation
    The requireed azure ml workspace and experiment was created and azure ml studio was used to run Azure ML Notebooks which inturn ran on coumte vms and calulations were done via the jupyter notebook on a 4 node cluster of cloud based VMs of size STANDARD_D2_V2. To avoid duplication same compute resourses and datset created were used for both hyperdrive method and automl method.

## Improving Results
    In future we can improve the best model by choosing different primary metrics and different classification methods and calculating and comparing the values of mean_squared_error, to study how our predictions have deviated from actual values and, we study mean absolute percent error (MAPE) in detail. We can also study the impact of increasing number of clusters used to study to get faster results. All these could help us in reducing error in our model and help us to study the model much faster. We can also add more data to the model, or we can add more columns. Also, we can make new columns with existing ones with feature engineering and by applying our domain knowledge and obtain better results. Also, we can provide a more user-friendly user interface wile consuming the apiâ€™s and the swager documentation. Lot of steps run on command-line can be ran directly from Jyupiter notebook or could be automated in a single script. We do have room to select more hyperparameters to tune in addtion to the two selected and tuned.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
    First the data was loaded into dataset and proper compute infra was created to run with suitable hyperdrive configuration. Random Sampling was choosen as it supports early termination of low-performance runs. In random sampling, hyperparameter values are randomly selected from the defined search space.
    
    Random Sampling was choosen as it supports early termination of low-performance runs. In random sampling, hyperparameter values are randomly selected from the defined search space with two hyperparameters '--C' (Reqularization Strength) and '--max_iter' (Maximum iterations to converge).
    
    enable_early_stopping = true, enables early termination if the score is not improving in the short term. BanditPolicy is an "aggressive" early stopping policy with the meaning that cuts more runs.

## Classification technique used: 
    Logistic Regression (Collumn to be classifed : DEATH_EVENT)

## Best Run Selection: 
    Selected out of multiple runs with same algorititm with diffrent hyperparameters.

## Confrugration Selected:

       
     early_termination_policy = BanditPolicy(slack_factor = 0.1, evaluation_interval = 1, delay_evaluation=5)
     (allowable slack = 0.1, frequency for applying the policy = 1, First policy evaluation done after 5 intervals)
     ps = RandomParameterSampling(
     {
        "--C" :        choice(0.001,0.01,0.1, 0.5, 1,1.5,10,20,50,100,200,500,1000), (Reqularization Strength search space)

        "--max_iter" : choice(25,50,75,100,200,300) (Maximum iterations to converge search space)

        }
     )
     src = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory=script_folder,
                     script='train.py',
                     compute_target=compute_target, (Compute Target or the Cluster to run the task on is selected as compute_target)
                     environment=sklearn_env (Environment for Sklearn selected as sklearn_env)
            )
    hyperdrive_run_config =  HyperDriveConfig(
    hyperparameter_sampling = ps,  (Hyperparameters)
    primary_metric_name = 'Accuracy', (Primary Metric is selected as Accuracy)
    primary_metric_goal = PrimaryMetricGoal.MAXIMIZE,  (Primary Metric Goal is selected as to maximize Accuracy)
    max_total_runs = 100, (Maximum 100 Child Runs)
    max_concurrent_runs = 4, (Maximum 4 iterations should run concurrently)
    policy = early_termination_policy,
    run_config = src
    )


## Results
    With the above selected confugration the Hyperdrive Pipeline shows best results with --c = 1 and --max_iter = 50 giving accuracy of  0.8133333333333334(approximate).

## Model Deployment
    The best performing model was a model with acuuracy of aproximately .0.87934 with AUC_weight =  0.92554 using VotingEnsemble algoritim obtained via AutoML Method. The respective model was registered and deployed as rest endpoint via a scoring uri and the deployment was verified by sending two sets of data picked from the original dataset and sent as JSON data to the service and the service predicted the output correctly.

## Standout Suggestions
    Convert Your Model to ONNX Format
    a) Hyperdrvive Method: The code to comvert and save the .joblib model to .onnx model was excecuted from the jupyter notebook.
    b) AutoML Method: The automl config was sent a setting to enable the onnx output via the jupyter code and respective ..onnx model was saved in .onnx format.
